    <p>My passion for health and fitness led me to as a personal trainer.</p>
    <p>
      I strongly believe in the necessity for an active lifestyle, encompassing
      a balanceof all the compulsory components of fitness.
    </p>
    <p>
      My philosophy focuses on continual lifelong learning as I work towards
      enhancingthe well-being of my clients by empowering them with the
      knowledge, skills, support, guidance and resources to assist and inspire
      them on their journey to a healthier life.

    <h2 class="title">EXPERIENCE</h2>
    <p>
      I have been working with clients face to face for over 4 years. In this
      time, I have put in thousands of hours each year helping people increase
      strength, overcome injuries, reduce body pain, lose body fat, increase
      muscle mass and a whole lot more.
    </p>
    <p>
      These are all wonderful accomplishments for my clients, and the key to
      success for helping them is without a doubt my unique approach to each and
      every client. I learned pretty quickly that the most important part to
      help a client achieve their goals is to simply listen to them, ask the
      right questions, and find the solutions that will work for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course I have acquired extensive knowledge about training program
      design, exercise selection, and nutrition. But to be honest, none of that
      would be of any use if I didnâ€™t have the ability to connect with clients
      and understand how to instill the knowledge, skills, and habits they need
      to make real changes for the long-run.
