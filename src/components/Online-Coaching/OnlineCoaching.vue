    <p>Simply put: My online clients get SO much more from me thanan in-person clientele ever could.</p>
    <p>At the same time, you still get the benefit of a qualified personal trainer to keep you on track, motivate you when you’re really not feeling up to it, and direct your exercise and nutrition routine so you can achieve your fitness goals.</p>
    <p>With upsides like the cost-effectiveness and real, trackable results, there’s no reason why you shouldn’t give it a try.</p>
